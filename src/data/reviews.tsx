      "Adam is an excellent professional and I can say this with complete authority, as I had the pleasure of leading him during his experience as a front-end monitor at Kenzie Academy.\n\nBeyond the technical skills that he acquired with ease, I highlight his passion for the community, for helping people, and his enormous desire to create something, a talent.\n\nAdam created a community named 'The Champions', and has been helping people ever since. I must highlight the period when I was his instructor, and the project group he was part of surprised us with an incredible project, using technologies beyond what we had taught, clearly showing their proactivity and thirst for learning.\n\nWell, if you've read this far, I believe that at this moment you're already calling Adam for a chat, to invite him to join your team, I wouldn't miss it for anything!",

    review: `Definitely one of the best devs I've had the opportunity to assist, always very dedicated, curious, determined, friendly, patient, his soft skills are definitely incredible. His creativity and ambition led him to accomplish amazing work, even being at the beginning of a new journey, always standing out among the class because of his empathy. I say this because, even though he had no obligation, he never stopped helping his colleagues who had more difficulties, and what excited me the most was the fact that he didn't just give answers, but rather taught the dev to find their doubts and solve them. As a professional, there's not much to say, his commitment and dedication are always clearly present. A phrase that I'm sure summarizes Adam: Given mission is accomplished mission. Because he doesn't disappoint, regardless of the difficulty.`,
